### Ebuilds related to the [`gentoo-on-rpi-64bit`](https://github.com/GenPi64/gentoo-on-rpi-64bit) image

> Note that for historical reasons, many of these ebuilds may contain `rpi3-` in the name, but yet still be applicable on the RPi4.
* **app-accessibility/onboard** [upstream](https://launchpad.net/onboard)
  * Provides a flexible onscreen keyboard. Included primarily for use with the official 7" RPi touchscreen. Adapted with thanks from original ebuild, [here](https://bitbucket.org/wjn/wjn-overlay).

* **net-wireless/rpi3-bluetooth** [upstream](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pi-bluetooth/)
  * Provides a startup service and `udev` rule for the RPi3/4's integrated Bluetooth transceiver. Adapted from the [`pi-bluetooth`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pi-bluetooth/) package from ArchLinux.

* **net-wireless/rpi3-wifi-regdom** Provides a simple service to set the WiFi regulatory domain; the value set may be modified by editing the file `/etc/conf.d/rpi3-wifi-regdom`.

* **sys-apps/pyconfig_gen** [upstream](https://github.com/GenPi64/pyconfig_gen)
  * Provides a simple, PyQt5 dialog-based app, to allow the `/boot/config.txt` file to be edited in a structured manner, together with some support services (to revert the new config automatically, unless ratified upon reboot).

* **sys-apps/rpi-gpio**
  * Sets up a `udev` rule to allow GPIO access (on the RPi3/4) for members of the `gpio` group.  On installation, all current members of `wheel` are automatically made members of `gpio`. Now installed for all users of the `rpi-64bit-meta` package (with `innercore` USE).

* **sys-apps/rpi-i2c**
  * Like `rpi3-i2cdev` (see below), sets up a `udev` rule to allow I2C access (on the RPi3/4) for members of the `i2c` group, and ensures that the `i2c_dev` module is `modprobe`d. On installation, all current members of `wheel` are automatically made members of `i2c` (to allow for straightforward transition from `rpi3-spidev`). Now installed for all users of the `rpi-64bit-meta` package (with `innercore` USE).

* **sys-apps/rpi-onetime-startup**
  * Provides a startup service which (having first disabled itself from running again) executes, as root, the script `/boot/startup.sh`, if present. This script can be used to e.g., set up initial WiFi networking on a headless system, thereby allowing an `ssh` connection to be established. The provided template `/boot/startup.sh` script contains several (commented out) examples of NetworkManager configuration.

* **sys-apps/rpi-serial**
  * Provides a `udev` rule to create appropriate serial port device aliases at `/dev/serial0` and/or `/dev/serial1` (using code borrowed from Raspbian).

* **sys-apps/rpi-spi**
  * Like `rpi3-spidev` (see below), sets up a `udev` rule to allow SPI access (on the RPi3/4) for members of the `spi` group. On installation, all current members of `wheel` are automatically made members of `spi` (to allow for straightforward transition from `rpi3-spidev`). Now installed for all users of the `rpi-64bit-meta` package (with `innercore` USE).

* **sys-apps/rpi-video**
  * Provides a `udev` rule to allow members of the `video` group access to `/dev/rpivid*` and `/dev/argon*` devices (using code borrowed from Raspbian).

* **sys-apps/rpi3-i2cdev**
  * Provides an OpenRC service and `udev` rule for I2C access on the RPi3/4. Ensures that the `i2c-dev` module is `modprobe`d, and that the `/dev/i2c-[0-9]` devices are read/write for all members of the `wheel` group, not just `root`. Originally installed by the `pitop` USE flag on `rpi-64bit-meta`, it has since been superseded by `rpi-i2c`, above.

* **sys-apps/rpi3-init-scripts**
  * Provides a few simple init scripts for the [gentoo-on-rpi-64bit](https://github.com/GenPi64/gentoo-on-rpi-64bit) image (to autoexpand the root partition on first boot, inhibit XVideo, setup cache usage appropriate for a low-memory environment etc.).

* **sys-apps/rpi3-ondemand-cpufreq**
  * Provides the `rpi3-ondemand` OpenRC `sysinit` service, to switch the RPi3 and RPi4 from its (`bcmrpi3_defconfig` and `bcm2711_defconfig`) default `powersave` CPU frequency governor, to `ondemand`, for better performance.

* **sys-apps/rpi3-spidev**
  * Provides a `udev` rule for SPI access on the RPi3; ensures that the `/dev/spidevN.M` devices are read/write for all members of the `wheel` group, not just `root`. Originally installed by the `pitop` USE flag on `rpi-64bit-meta`, it has since been superseded by `rpi-spi`, above.

* **sys-firmware/bcm4340a1-firmware** [upstream](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pi-bluetooth/)
  * Provides firmware (`/etc/firmware/BCM43430A1.hcd`) for the RPi's integrated Bluetooth transceiver. Adapted from the [`pi-bluetooth`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pi-bluetooth/) package from ArchLinux. Required by `net-wireless/rpi3-bluetooth` package (see above).

* **sys-firmware/brcm43430-firmware** [upstream](https://github.com/RPi-Distro/firmware-nonfree)
  * Provides a configuration file (`brcmfmac43430-sdio.txt`) that is required for the RPi3/4's integrated WiFi (the main firmware is provided already, by [`sys-kernel/linux-firmware`](http://packages.gentoo.org/package/sys-kernel/linux-firmware)). Now also provides the equivalent file `brcmfmac43455-sdio.txt`, for use with the RPi3 B+ / RPi 4 B's [dual-band WiFi](https://www.raspberrypi.com.tw/tag/bcm2837/) WiFi chip set (Cypress CYW43455), plus the matching `brcmfmac43430-sdio.clm_blob`, and, when the `43455-fix` USE flag is set, also provides a more modern copy of the uploadable file `/lib/firmware/brcm/brcmfmac43455-sdio.bin` (in preference to the older version shipped with `sys-kernel/linux-firmware`; see below).

* **x11-misc/rpi3-safecompositor**
  * Provides an eponymous OpenRC service to off display compositing, on the RPi3 only, if a high pixel clock is detected (> 1.2175MHz, currently). This is because certain applications, for example LibreOffice v6 Draw and Impress, can cause the whole system to lock-up when used with compositing on under such conditions. As of v1.4.0 of the image / v1.0.1 of the ebuild, also turns of compositing when 'true' kms mode (`vc4-kms-v3d`) is in use.

* **x11-misc/twofing** [upstream](http://plippo.de/p/twofing)
  * Provides the `twofing` daemon, which converts touchscreen gestures into mouse and keyboard events. Included primarily for use with the offical 7" RPi (1,2,3) touchscreen (not sure if this is yet compatible with the RPi4?).

## Other directories of interest

* **metadata/news**
  * This simply contains some [GLEP 42](https://www.gentoo.org/glep/glep-0042.html)-compliant news items, specific to users of this overlay (and/or the [bootable image](https://github.com/GenPi64/gentoo-on-rpi-64bit)).

* **profiles/...**
  * This specifies the custom *profile* used by the bootable image, which contains a number of custom USE-flag assignments, package masks, keyword overrides and so forth. For more details, please see the notes [here](https://github.com/GenPi64/gentoo-on-rpi-64bit#profile).
